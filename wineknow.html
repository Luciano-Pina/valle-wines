            The wine country of Argentina looks back on more than 400 years of history. As early as the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors brought vines into the country - they needed wine for the Holy Mass. They found ideal conditions in the foothills of the Andes. In 1561 they founded the city of Mendoza and planted the first vineyards around it. Soon the locals got involved in wine production, irrigation canals were dug and the first export routes were even built to the capital Buenos Aires and to the neighboring countries of Chile and Bolivia.
            The country experienced a second surge in development in the 19th century. European immigrants, many of them from Italy, Spain or France, came across the pond with knowledge of wine and viticulture or even with seedlings. In 1853 a state agricultural school was established in Mendoza; at their head stood a Frenchman. He established French grape varieties in the area - an important cornerstone for the current success of the Argentine wine industry.            </p>

                <h4>Quality Revolution in the 1990s</h4>
                For a long time, however, the focus was not on quality. Instead, they mass-produced cheap drops for the thirsty local market.
                This changed with the advent of beer and soft drinks. Domestic consumption fell rapidly: from 90 liters of wine (!) per capita in 1970 to 55 liters in 1991. The area under vines shrank by a good third at that time. What meant a heavy blow economically was a blessing in terms of quality: now the quality era of Argentine viticulture began. In 1983, after the end of the dictatorship, foreign investors also came to the country with know-how and money. And so Argentina, as a wine nation, has a lot to offer in terms of top quality today.

                <h4>From Patagonia to the high mountains</h4>
                The vineyards in the Andes extend to more than  210,000 hectares . The vines grow far away from the cities, from the rough Patagonia in the very south of the continent to the high altitudes in the north - there the Swiss Donald Hess has   the  highest vineyard in the world with his winery Bodegas Colomé created. Argentina's trump card is its different altitudes. They provide an extraordinarily diverse puzzle of soils and microclimates. So every grape variety finds its favorite place. There is a continental climate, which is expressed in significant temperature differences between day and night. This allows the grapes to ripen slowly and evenly. Other quality ingredients are the barren soils, which vines love, and the clean melt water of the Andes.

                <h4>Mendoza, new home of Malbec</h4>
                The country's best-known growing area is still called Mendoza. Here, in the shadow of Aconcagua, the highest mountain on the American continent (6960 meters), over 70 percent of Argentine wine is produced. The flagship variety of the region and Argentina's flagship grape is the dark berry, structurally strong Malbec. This French “import” feels more at home there than anywhere else in the world; even more than in its home town of Cahors in south-west France. Many winegrowers marry it with Cabernet Sauvignon. San Juan , which is north of Mendoza and enjoys a slightly warmer climate, follows in the ranking of the largest wine regions  . In recent years, Syrah has blossomed into a flagship among red wines.
                Among the white wines, the  Torrontés  stands out, an autochthonous variety that produces wonderfully flowery drops. Their playgrounds are the high elevations of the regions of  La Rioja  (not to be confused with the wine region of the same name in Spain) and  Salta . Here the grapes also benefit from increased UV radiation - their aroma becomes particularly intense.
